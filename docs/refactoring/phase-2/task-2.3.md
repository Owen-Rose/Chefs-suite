# Task 2.3: Integrate Structured Logging

## Goal
Enhance the application's logging system to provide consistent, structured logs across all components, making it easier to monitor application behavior, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance.

## Background
The application currently has a basic Logger class, but its usage is inconsistent across the codebase. By implementing a more robust logging system with standardized log formats, context information, and support for external logging services, we can improve the application's observability.

## Implementation Steps

1. Enhance the Logger class with additional features:
   - Support for structured log formats (JSON)
   - Request ID tracking for correlating logs
   - Log level configuration based on environment
   - Support for common logging patterns (e.g., request logging, error logging)
   - Integration with external logging services

2. Implement a request context middleware to track request-specific information:
   - Generate and track request IDs
   - Track timing information
   - Store user/session information when available

3. Create utility functions for common logging patterns:
   - Request logging (start/end)
   - API call logging (external services)
   - Error logging with proper stack traces
   - Performance logging

4. Add configuration options for log levels and destinations:
   - Environment-based log level settings
   - Console logging for development
   - File logging for certain environments
   - External service integration for production

5. Integrate with the error handling middleware to ensure all errors are properly logged

6. Create utility to sanitize sensitive data in logs

## Files to Create/Modify
- `utils/logger.ts` (enhance existing file)
- `lib/logging-middleware.ts` (new file)
- `lib/request-context.ts` (new file)
- `utils/logging-utils.ts` (new file)
- `lib/middleware.ts` (update to include logging middleware)

## Verification Steps
1. Run TypeScript compiler to ensure no type errors
2. Check that all levels of logs are properly formatted
3. Verify that request IDs are correctly propagated through the application
4. Test that sensitive information is properly sanitized in logs
5. Verify that logs can be searched and filtered effectively

## Dependencies
- Task 2.2: Implement Error Handling Middleware (to integrate error logging)

## Estimated Effort
Medium (3-4 hours)

## Notes
- Consider using an established logging library like Winston or Pino instead of a custom implementation
- Ensure logging doesn't significantly impact performance
- Consider log rotation and size limits for file-based logging
- Add ability to dynamically change log levels for debugging
- Document logging conventions for the development team
