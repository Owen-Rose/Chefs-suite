# Task 2.5: Update Invitation Service with Error Handling

## Goal
Enhance the Invitation Service with robust error handling using the new custom error classes, ensuring clear and informative error reporting for all invitation-related operations.

## Background
The Invitation Service manages user invitations, a critical flow for user onboarding. It requires precise error handling to ensure that invitation creation, verification, and completion processes are reliable and provide clear feedback when issues occur.

## Implementation Steps

1. Update the Invitation Service to use the new custom error classes:
   - Replace generic Error throws with appropriate custom errors
   - Implement domain-specific error messages for invitation flows
   - Add proper error context for debugging

2. Enhance validation for invitation operations:
   - Add comprehensive validation for email formats
   - Validate token formats and expiration dates
   - Ensure proper status transitions with meaningful errors
   - Use ValidationError with field details for validation failures

3. Implement proper error handling for email sending:
   - Create specific error types for email delivery failures
   - Handle various email provider errors consistently
   - Add retry logic for transient email delivery issues

4. Add handling for concurrent operations:
   - Ensure proper locking or versioning for invitation updates
   - Handle race conditions with clear error messages
   - Add conflict detection and resolution

5. Improve error reporting for invitation verification:
   - Create user-friendly messages for expired invitations
   - Handle already-used invitations with clear explanations
   - Provide guidance on next steps in error messages

6. Implement logging throughout the invitation flow:
   - Log all invitation lifecycle events
   - Track email sending success and failures
   - Record invitation verification attempts

## Files to Create/Modify
- `services/invitationService.ts` (update)
- `services/email/mailgun-email-service.ts` (update)
- `errors/InvitationErrors.ts` (potentially new file for domain-specific errors)
- `__tests__/services/invitationService.test.ts` (update)

## Verification Steps
1. Run TypeScript compiler to ensure no type errors
2. Run unit tests for the Invitation Service
3. Test error handling for various error scenarios:
   - Invalid email formats
   - Expired tokens
   - Already used invitations
   - Email delivery failures
   - Concurrent modifications
4. Verify that error messages are user-friendly and actionable
5. Check that logs capture all critical invitation events

## Dependencies
- Task 2.1: Create Custom Error Classes
- Task 2.3: Integrate Structured Logging

## Estimated Effort
Medium (3-4 hours)

## Notes
- Ensure invitation error messages are user-friendly
- Add security considerations for invitation-related errors
- Consider rate limiting for invitation operations
- Document error handling patterns specific to invitations
- Be careful not to leak sensitive information in error messages
