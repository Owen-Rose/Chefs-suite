# Task 6.1: Set Up Testing Infrastructure

## Goal
Establish a comprehensive testing infrastructure with standardized patterns for different types of tests (unit, integration, API, component), enabling consistent test coverage across the application and supporting the refactoring process.

## Background
A robust testing infrastructure is essential for confident refactoring. Currently, the application has some tests, but there's no standardized approach across different layers. This task will establish consistent testing patterns and tools to ensure code quality and prevent regressions during refactoring.

## Implementation Steps

1. Evaluate and upgrade the testing framework:
   - Review current Jest setup and configuration
   - Configure Vitest as an alternative for faster performance (if appropriate)
   - Set up TypeScript integration for tests
   - Configure code coverage reporting

2. Establish repository testing patterns:
   - Create a test database configuration for integration tests
   - Implement test utilities for database setup and teardown
   - Develop factory functions for test data generation
   - Create base test classes for repository tests

3. Set up service layer testing:
   - Create mocking utilities for repository dependencies
   - Establish patterns for testing service business logic
   - Implement test helpers for common service testing scenarios
   - Set up transaction management for service tests

4. Implement API testing framework:
   - Configure API test utilities with request helpers
   - Set up authentication helpers for protected endpoints
   - Create middleware testing utilities
   - Implement response validation helpers

5. Establish UI component testing:
   - Set up React Testing Library configuration
   - Configure component testing utilities and helpers
   - Establish snapshot testing patterns
   - Set up accessibility testing tools

6. Implement end-to-end testing infrastructure (if needed):
   - Configure Cypress or Playwright for end-to-end tests
   - Create test utilities for common user flows
   - Set up test data seeding for end-to-end tests

7. Create test documentation:
   - Document testing patterns and best practices
   - Create examples for each test type
   - Establish naming conventions and folder structure
   - Document test data generation approach

## Files to Create/Modify
- `jest.config.js` or `vitest.config.ts` (update)
- `__tests__/setup.ts` (create or update)
- `__tests__/utils/` (new directory with test utilities)
- `__tests__/factories/` (new directory with test data factories)
- `__tests__/mocks/` (standardize mock implementations)
- Documentation for testing standards

## Verification Steps
1. Run the test suite to ensure all existing tests pass
2. Verify code coverage reporting works correctly
3. Test the database integration test setup
4. Verify mock utilities work as expected
5. Run example tests for each layer of the application

## Dependencies
None - this is a foundational task

## Estimated Effort
Medium (4-5 hours)

## Notes
- Focus on creating reusable patterns rather than writing many tests at this stage
- Document testing patterns clearly for other developers
- Prioritize test speed to encourage frequent testing
- Consider test isolation vs. integration testing tradeoffs
- Set up CI integration for running tests automatically
- Consider implementing a pre-commit hook for running relevant tests
