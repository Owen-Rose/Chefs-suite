# Task 2.4: Update Recipe Service with Error Handling

## Goal
Refactor the Recipe Service to incorporate the new error handling system, ensuring consistent error handling patterns and improved error reporting for recipe-related operations.

## Background
The Recipe Service is a critical component that manages recipe data operations. It currently has basic error handling, but needs to be updated to use the new custom error classes and follow consistent error handling patterns established in the refactoring.

## Implementation Steps

1. Update the Recipe Service to use the new custom error classes:
   - Replace generic Error throws with appropriate custom errors
   - Add context information to error messages
   - Ensure proper error propagation

2. Add proper validation with clear error messages:
   - Input validation for recipe creation and updates
   - Business rule validation with descriptive messages
   - Use ValidationError for validation failures with field details

3. Implement transaction handling and rollback for multi-step operations:
   - Add transaction context support for operations that modify multiple entities
   - Properly handle errors during transactions to ensure data consistency

4. Add error logging throughout the service:
   - Log errors with appropriate severity levels
   - Include relevant context with errors
   - Track operation performance metrics

5. Implement retry logic for transient errors:
   - Identify operations that could benefit from retries
   - Add configurable retry policies with backoff
   - Log retry attempts and final outcomes

6. Create specific error classes for recipe-related errors if needed:
   - Consider domain-specific error types
   - Add specialized error handling for import/export operations

## Files to Create/Modify
- `services/recipeService.ts` (update)
- `errors/RecipeErrors.ts` (potentially new file for domain-specific errors)
- `__tests__/services/recipeService.test.ts` (update)

## Verification Steps
1. Run TypeScript compiler to ensure no type errors
2. Run unit tests for the Recipe Service
3. Test error handling for various error scenarios:
   - Validation errors
   - Not found errors
   - Database errors
   - Business rule violations
4. Verify that all errors provide meaningful messages
5. Check that error details are appropriate for the error type

## Dependencies
- Task 2.1: Create Custom Error Classes
- Task 2.3: Integrate Structured Logging
- Task 1.2: Implement Recipe Repository

## Estimated Effort
Medium (3-4 hours)

## Notes
- Focus on user-friendly error messages
- Ensure errors include sufficient context for debugging
- Consider error localization for internationalization
- Document error handling patterns for other developers
- Be careful not to expose sensitive data in error messages
