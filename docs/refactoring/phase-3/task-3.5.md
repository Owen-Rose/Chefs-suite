# Task 3.5: Migrate Navigation Components

## Goal
Migrate all navigation-related components (menus, tabs, breadcrumbs, pagination) to use shadcn/ui components, ensuring consistent navigation patterns and improved accessibility across the application.

## Background
Navigation components are critical for user experience and application flow. Standardizing these components will improve usability, accessibility, and maintain visual consistency.

## Implementation Steps

1. Analyze current navigation patterns:
   - Review the component inventory for navigation components
   - Identify common navigation patterns and inconsistencies
   - Note navigation hierarchy and relationships

2. Implement core navigation components:
   - Set up shadcn/ui NavigationMenu component
   - Implement responsive mobile navigation
   - Create consistent header navigation 
   - Develop sidebar navigation component

3. Migrate secondary navigation components:
   - Implement Tabs component for content switching
   - Create Breadcrumbs component for hierarchical navigation
   - Develop Pagination component for multi-page content
   - Implement Stepper component for multi-step processes

4. Create specialized navigation helpers:
   - Implement link highlighting for active routes
   - Create skip-to-content links for accessibility
   - Develop navigation groups and nested menus
   - Implement keyboard navigation enhancements

5. Develop mobile-specific navigation:
   - Create responsive drawer/hamburger menu
   - Implement bottom navigation for mobile
   - Develop mobile-specific navigation patterns
   - Ensure proper touch targets and spacing

6. Update application header and layout:
   - Implement the new header navigation
   - Update sidebar navigation if applicable
   - Ensure consistent responsive behavior
   - Maintain proper navigation state management

7. Integrate with routing system:
   - Ensure proper integration with Next.js routing
   - Implement route-based active state highlighting
   - Create route guard integration if needed
   - Develop deep linking support

8. Document navigation system:
   - Create usage guidelines for navigation components
   - Document navigation patterns and best practices
   - Provide examples for different navigation scenarios

## Files to Create/Modify
- `components/ui/navigation-menu.tsx` (update)
- `components/ui/tabs.tsx` (create or update)
- `components/ui/breadcrumb.tsx` (create)
- `components/ui/pagination.tsx` (create)
- `components/layout/Header.tsx` (update)
- `components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` (update if applicable)
- `components/MobileNavigation.tsx` (create or update)
- Various page files using navigation components

## Verification Steps
1. Run TypeScript compiler to ensure no type errors
2. Test navigation on different viewport sizes
3. Verify keyboard navigation and screen reader accessibility
4. Test active state highlighting on different routes
5. Verify deep linking and route preservation

## Dependencies
- Task 3.1: Create Component Migration Inventory
- Task 3.2: Migrate Basic UI Components
- Task 3.3: Migrate Layout Components

## Estimated Effort
Medium (5-6 hours)

## Notes
- Focus on maintaining backward compatibility for existing navigation
- Ensure all navigation is fully keyboard accessible
- Consider implementation of aria landmarks and roles
- Test navigation with screen readers for accessibility
- Ensure smooth transitions between navigation states
- Consider performance implications of complex navigation
- Document navigation conventions for other developers
