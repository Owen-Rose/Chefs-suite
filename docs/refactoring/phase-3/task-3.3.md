# Task 3.3: Migrate Layout Components

## Goal
Migrate layout components (containers, grids, flexbox layouts) to use a consistent, responsive approach based on shadcn/ui and modern CSS practices, ensuring a uniform layout system across the application.

## Background
The application may be using inconsistent layout patterns across different pages and components. Standardizing layout components will improve maintenance, responsiveness, and visual consistency.

## Implementation Steps

1. Analyze current layout patterns:
   - Review the component inventory for layout components
   - Identify common layout patterns (grids, containers, split views)
   - Note responsive behavior and breakpoints used

2. Develop a layout component system:
   - Create base Container component with consistent padding and max-width
   - Implement responsive Grid component with configurable columns
   - Develop Flex component for flexible layouts
   - Create Section component for page segmentation

3. Implement layout primitives:
   - Create spacing utility components (Stack, Spacer)
   - Develop responsive container components
   - Implement visibility helpers for responsive designs
   - Create aspect-ratio containers for media content

4. Update Layout component:
   - Refactor the main Layout component using the new layout system
   - Ensure header, footer, and content areas use consistent spacing
   - Implement responsive behavior for different viewport sizes

5. Migrate page layouts:
   - Update each page layout to use the new layout components
   - Ensure consistent spacing and alignment
   - Verify responsive behavior across all breakpoints

6. Create layout documentation:
   - Document layout system principles and components
   - Create usage examples for common layout patterns
   - Provide guidelines for responsive design

7. Implement visual regression testing:
   - Create tests for layout components
   - Verify layouts at different viewport sizes
   - Capture before/after screenshots

## Files to Create/Modify
- `components/layout/Container.tsx` (new or update)
- `components/layout/Grid.tsx` (new or update)
- `components/layout/Flex.tsx` (new or update)
- `components/layout/Stack.tsx` (new or update)
- `components/layout/Layout.tsx` (update)
- Various page files using layout components
- `docs/layout-system.md` (new documentation file)

## Verification Steps
1. Run TypeScript compiler to ensure no type errors
2. Test layouts at various viewport sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
3. Verify consistent spacing and alignment across the application
4. Check accessibility of layout components (proper landmarks, etc.)
5. Verify performance of layout rendering

## Dependencies
- Task 3.1: Create Component Migration Inventory
- Task 3.2: Migrate Basic UI Components

## Estimated Effort
Medium-Large (6-8 hours)

## Notes
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox rather than older approaches
- Consider CSS custom properties for spacing consistency
- Ensure layout components maintain proper DOM hierarchy for accessibility
- Document responsive breakpoints and naming conventions
- Consider performance implications of deeply nested layout components
- Use semantic HTML elements where appropriate
