# Task 3.6: Remove Material UI Dependencies

## Goal
Completely remove Material UI dependencies from the codebase and ensure all components have been successfully migrated to shadcn/ui, resulting in a more consistent design system and reduced bundle size.

## Background
After migrating individual component categories to shadcn/ui, this final task ensures complete removal of Material UI dependencies and validates the migration process. This will reduce bundle size, improve performance, and ensure design system consistency.

## Implementation Steps

1. Audit remaining Material UI dependencies:
   - Run dependency analysis to identify remaining Material UI imports
   - Review codebase for any overlooked Material UI components
   - Document any components that still need migration

2. Migrate any remaining components:
   - Address any components missed in previous migration tasks
   - Create shadcn/ui alternatives for any specialized components
   - Update any remaining imports to use new components

3. Remove Material UI packages:
   - Update package.json to remove Material UI dependencies
   - Remove Material UI theme configuration
   - Remove any Material UI utility functions
   - Update build configuration if necessary

4. Verify styling consistency:
   - Review the application for visual inconsistencies
   - Ensure theme variables are properly applied
   - Address any styling regressions
   - Validate responsive behavior

5. Run performance benchmarks:
   - Measure bundle size before and after removal
   - Compare build times and runtime performance
   - Document performance improvements
   - Address any performance regressions

6. Update documentation:
   - Update component documentation to reflect changes
   - Remove references to Material UI in documentation
   - Document the migration process for future reference
   - Update storybook if applicable

7. Clean up migration artifacts:
   - Remove any temporary compatibility layers
   - Clean up unused CSS variables or theme values
   - Remove migration-specific code comments
   - Archive migration documentation

## Files to Create/Modify
- `package.json` (remove Material UI dependencies)
- Any files still using Material UI components
- `README.md` (update documentation)
- `docs/component-library.md` (update)

## Verification Steps
1. Run TypeScript compiler to ensure no type errors
2. Run `npm ls @mui` to verify no Material UI dependencies remain
3. Build application and check for any Material UI related warnings/errors
4. Run visual regression tests to ensure consistent styling
5. Verify bundle size reduction and performance improvements
6. Run accessibility tests on migrated components

## Dependencies
- Task 3.2: Migrate Basic UI Components
- Task 3.3: Migrate Layout Components
- Task 3.4: Migrate Form Components
- Task 3.5: Migrate Navigation Components

## Estimated Effort
Medium (4-5 hours)

## Notes
- Some Material UI components might not have direct equivalents in shadcn/ui
- Consider creating custom components for specific needs
- Focus on maintaining consistent user experience during transition
- Document any changes in component APIs for other developers
- Ensure proper theme integration between any custom components
- This task completes the UI migration process, ensuring a clean break from Material UI
