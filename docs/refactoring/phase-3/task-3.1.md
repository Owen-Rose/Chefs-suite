# Task 3.1: Create Component Migration Inventory

## Goal
Create a comprehensive inventory of all UI components in the application, categorize them by type, identify their dependencies, and develop a prioritized migration plan for transitioning to a more consistent component architecture.

## Background
The application currently has a mix of UI components with inconsistent styling and implementation patterns. Before migrating components, we need a clear understanding of the component landscape, including usage patterns, shared dependencies, and potential migration challenges.

## Implementation Steps

1. Analyze the codebase to identify all UI components:
   - List all component files from the `components/` directory
   - Identify components embedded in page files
   - Note component inheritance/composition relationships

2. Categorize components by type:
   - Basic UI elements (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.)
   - Layout components (containers, grids, etc.)
   - Form components (form groups, validation, etc.)
   - Navigation components (menus, tabs, etc.)
   - Feature-specific components (recipe cards, user lists, etc.)

3. Document component dependencies:
   - Material UI dependencies
   - Custom styling approaches (CSS, styled-components, etc.)
   - State management dependencies
   - Shared utility functions

4. Assess component usage patterns:
   - Identify the most widely used components
   - Note components with duplicate functionality
   - Identify inconsistent implementation patterns

5. Create a detailed component inventory spreadsheet with:
   - Component name and file path
   - Component category
   - Dependencies
   - Usage count and locations
   - Migration complexity (Low/Medium/High)
   - Priority for migration
   - Notes on special considerations

6. Develop a migration strategy document outlining:
   - Migration approach for each component category
   - Order of migration to minimize disruption
   - Testing strategy for component migrations
   - Guidelines for component API compatibility

7. Identify components that can be replaced with shadcn/ui equivalents

## Files to Create/Modify
- `docs/refactoring/component-inventory.md` (new file)
- `docs/refactoring/component-migration-strategy.md` (new file)
- `docs/refactoring/shadcn-ui-mapping.md` (new file)

## Verification Steps
1. Cross-check the component inventory against the codebase to ensure completeness
2. Verify component usage counts and locations
3. Review migration strategy with team members for feedback
4. Test proposed component replacements for API compatibility

## Dependencies
None - this is a foundational analysis task

## Estimated Effort
Medium (4-5 hours)

## Notes
- Focus on identifying shared patterns and inconsistencies
- Consider accessibility requirements when planning migrations
- Document component prop interfaces for API compatibility
- Note responsive behavior of existing components
- Consider performance implications of component replacements
