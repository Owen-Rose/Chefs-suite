# Task 3.4: Migrate Form Components

## Goal
Migrate all form-related components to use shadcn/ui form components and React Hook Form, creating a consistent, accessible, and type-safe form system across the application.

## Background
The application likely uses various approaches to form handling. Standardizing on shadcn/ui form components with React Hook Form will improve validation, accessibility, and developer experience.

## Implementation Steps

1. Set up foundational form components:
   - Configure shadcn/ui Form component
   - Set up React Hook Form integration
   - Configure Zod for form validation schemas
   - Create reusable form field components

2. Create a pattern for form validation:
   - Implement consistent validation schema approach using Zod
   - Create helper functions for common validation patterns
   - Define standard error message formats
   - Set up client-side and server-side validation integration

3. Migrate basic form fields:
   - Replace input components with Form input components
   - Migrate textarea components
   - Update select/dropdown components
   - Implement checkbox and radio button components

4. Migrate complex form components:
   - Create multi-select components
   - Implement date/time pickers
   - Develop file upload components
   - Implement autocomplete/typeahead components

5. Create specialized form layouts:
   - Implement form sections with fieldsets
   - Create responsive form layouts
   - Develop inline form components
   - Implement form accordions for complex forms

6. Develop form submission patterns:
   - Create standard loading and error states
   - Implement submission handling utilities
   - Develop form status indicators
   - Create form submission progress components

7. Migrate existing forms:
   - Update user registration and login forms
   - Migrate recipe creation/editing forms
   - Update profile and settings forms
   - Migrate invitation forms

8. Document form system:
   - Create usage guidelines for form components
   - Document validation patterns
   - Provide examples of common form scenarios

## Files to Create/Modify
- `components/ui/form.tsx` (update or create)
- `components/ui/` (various form field components)
- `lib/validations/` (validation schemas)
- `components/forms/` (reusable form templates)
- Various files containing forms

## Verification Steps
1. Run TypeScript compiler to ensure no type errors
2. Test form validation for various scenarios
3. Verify form accessibility using screen readers and keyboard
4. Test form submission and error handling
5. Verify responsive behavior of forms on different devices

## Dependencies
- Task 3.1: Create Component Migration Inventory
- Task 3.2: Migrate Basic UI Components

## Estimated Effort
Large (8-10 hours)

## Notes
- Prioritize accessibility in form design
- Ensure proper tab order and keyboard navigation
- Create consistent error presentation across all forms
- Document migration patterns for other developers
- Consider form analytics and tracking
- Ensure server-side validation matches client-side
- Focus on a great developer experience with TypeScript integration
