# Task 3.2: Migrate Basic UI Components

## Goal
Migrate basic UI components (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.) to use shadcn/ui as the foundation, ensuring a consistent design system and improving component reusability across the application.

## Background
The application currently uses a mix of custom components and potentially Material UI for basic UI elements. Standardizing on shadcn/ui will provide consistent styling, accessibility, and behavior while reducing maintenance overhead.

## Implementation Steps

1. Set up shadcn/ui components that will replace the basic UI elements:
   - Review the component inventory to identify all basic UI components
   - Install and configure the required shadcn/ui components
   - Ensure the theme configuration aligns with the application's design system

2. Create wrapper components to ensure API compatibility:
   - Create wrapper components that maintain the same interface as existing components
   - Implement any custom functionality not provided by shadcn/ui
   - Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all props

3. Migrate button components:
   - Replace custom button implementations with shadcn/ui Button
   - Ensure all variants (primary, secondary, text, icon) are supported
   - Maintain existing event handling and prop patterns

4. Migrate input components:
   - Replace text inputs, textareas, and other input elements
   - Preserve validation behaviors and error states
   - Ensure focus and blur handlers are properly migrated

5. Migrate card components:
   - Replace card containers with shadcn/ui Card components
   - Maintain proper layout and content hierarchy
   - Ensure responsive behavior is preserved

6. Migrate other basic UI elements:
   - Alerts and notifications
   - Badges
   - Avatars
   - Tooltips
   - Dividers and separators

7. Create visual regression tests:
   - Create Storybook stories for migrated components
   - Set up visual regression testing to capture UI differences
   - Document and review any visual changes

8. Update component usage documentation:
   - Create guidelines for the migrated components
   - Document the available variants and props
   - Provide migration examples for other developers

## Files to Create/Modify
- `components/ui/` (update shadcn/ui components)
- `components/common/` (create wrapper components as needed)
- Various files using basic UI components (replace component imports)
- `docs/component-library.md` (update documentation)

## Verification Steps
1. Run TypeScript compiler to ensure no type errors
2. Verify visual appearance matches original components
3. Test all interactive behaviors (click, hover, focus)
4. Verify accessibility using automated tools
5. Test responsive behavior across different viewport sizes

## Dependencies
- Task 3.1: Create Component Migration Inventory

## Estimated Effort
Large (8-10 hours)

## Notes
- Focus on maintaining backward compatibility for existing usage
- Consider creating a visual guide comparing old and new components
- Update Storybook documentation if available
- Pay special attention to accessibility features
- Consider adding custom CSS variables to match existing styling
- Document any behavior changes for team awareness
