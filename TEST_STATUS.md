# Test Status Report

## Overview
The test suite has been partially fixed, with significant progress made in addressing the initial issues. However, some tests are still failing and require additional attention.

## Fixed Issues
1. ✅ **Container Class Tests**: Added comprehensive tests for the Container class which are now passing.
2. ✅ **Ingredient Type Definitions**: Fixed type errors in Ingredient and Recipe interfaces.
3. ✅ **InvitationUtils Token Length**: Updated tests to match the actual token length (96 characters).
4. ✅ **Jest Configuration**: Updated Jest configuration to handle ESM modules from next-auth and related dependencies.
5. ✅ **Recipe API Endpoint Tests**: Fixed id.test.ts and import.test.ts to align with the repository pattern implementation.

## Remaining Issues
Some tests are still failing and will require more focused attention:

1. **Email Service Tests**:
   - `mailgun-email-service.test.ts` has issues with mocking the Mailgun client.
   - HTML stripping tests are failing due to different newline expectations.

2. **Invitation API Tests**:
   - `invitations/index.test.ts` and `invitations/verify/[token].test.ts` are failing with status code mismatches.

3. **Recipe Import Tests**:
   - The import endpoint test expects a 200 status but receives 400.
   - Error message differences in import validation tests.

4. **Next Auth Tests**:
   - The mock implementation needs refinement as the authorize function isn't properly mocked.

## Recommendations
1. **Address Tests Individually**: Each failing test category requires specific attention to the mocking approach and expectations.

2. **Mock Integration Points**: Many failures are due to improper mocking of external dependencies. Ensure all integration points are properly mocked.

3. **Update Test Expectations**: Some tests are failing because the implementation has changed. Update the test expectations to match the current implementation.

4. **Fix Service Integration Tests**: Prioritize fixing the service integration tests for the email service.

5. **API Endpoint Testing**: Review all API endpoint tests to ensure they're using the correct approaches for testing next-connect routes.

## Next Steps
1. Group the failing tests by module and address them one module at a time.
2. Prioritize tests for core functionality like user authentication and recipe management.
3. Create unit tests for any untested components identified during this process.
4. Update the test documentation to reflect the current testing approaches.

## Test Coverage
Current test coverage is improving but still has gaps that need to be addressed. After fixing the failing tests, a complete coverage report should be generated to identify areas needing additional test coverage.
