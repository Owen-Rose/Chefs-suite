# Recipe Web App Refactoring Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive refactoring plan for the Recipe Web App project. The plan is broken down into phases and granular tasks with clear scopes and verification steps.

## Overview

The refactoring effort focuses on:

1. Standardizing the repository pattern
2. Improving error handling
3. Unifying UI components
4. Enhancing data fetching
5. Strengthening authentication
6. Building a robust testing foundation
7. Gradually migrating to App Router (future phase)

## Task Tracking

All tasks are tracked in the `docs/refactoring` directory with the following structure:
- `phase-1/`: Foundational Improvements
- `phase-2/`: Architecture Enhancement
- `phase-3/`: App Router Migration

Each task markdown file follows a standard format with:
- Goal
- Implementation steps
- Verification methods
- Completion status

## Implementation Strategy

For each task:

1. **Before starting**: Run the full test suite to establish baseline
2. **During implementation**: Create or update tests for the specific feature
3. **After completion**: Run the full test suite again
4. **Manual verification**: Test the specific feature in the UI

## Development Flow

1. Branch from `master` with the naming convention `refactor/<phase>-<task-number>-<short-description>`
2. Complete the task with appropriate tests
3. Run linting and type checking
4. Create a pull request with reference to the task document
5. After review, merge back to `master`

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

To minimize risks during this significant refactoring effort:

### Incremental Approach
- Prioritize smaller, incremental changes over big-bang refactoring
- Sequence tasks to maintain a functioning application at each step
- Focus on one layer of the application at a time

### Testing Safeguards
- Maintain and expand test coverage before modifying code
- Create regression tests for critical user flows
- Use TypeScript to catch type-related regressions early

### Safe Rollout
- Consider implementing feature flags for high-risk changes
- Use feature toggles to enable new implementations gradually
- Maintain compatibility layers when changing core APIs

### Monitoring and Rollback
- Establish performance baselines before changes
- Monitor error rates after deployments
- Prepare rollback procedures for each significant change
- Document known issues and workarounds

### Knowledge Sharing
- Document architectural decisions in each task file
- Create diagrams for complex interactions
- Perform knowledge-sharing sessions for significant changes

## Performance Considerations

Throughout the refactoring process, we will:

- Establish performance metrics before beginning work
- Benchmark key operations before and after changes
- Monitor bundle size impacts
- Ensure refactoring doesn't negatively impact user experience
- Prioritize performance improvements where possible

## Project Status Dashboard

Current progress is tracked in `docs/refactoring/STATUS.md` which is updated after each task completion.
