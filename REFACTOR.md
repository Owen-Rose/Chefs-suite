# Recipe Web App Refactoring Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive refactoring plan for the Recipe Web App project. The plan is broken down into phases and granular tasks with clear scopes and verification steps.

## Overview

The refactoring effort focuses on:

1. Standardizing the repository pattern
2. Improving error handling
3. Unifying UI components
4. Enhancing data fetching
5. Strengthening authentication
6. Building a robust testing foundation
7. Gradually migrating to App Router (future phase)

## Task Tracking

All tasks are tracked in the `docs/refactoring` directory with the following structure:
- `phase-1/`: Foundational Improvements
- `phase-2/`: Architecture Enhancement
- `phase-3/`: App Router Migration

Each task markdown file follows a standard format with:
- Goal
- Implementation steps
- Verification methods
- Completion status

## Implementation Strategy

For each task:

1. **Before starting**: Run the full test suite to establish baseline
2. **During implementation**: Create or update tests for the specific feature
3. **After completion**: Run the full test suite again
4. **Manual verification**: Test the specific feature in the UI

## Development Flow

1. Branch from `master` with the naming convention `refactor/<phase>-<task-number>-<short-description>`
2. Complete the task with appropriate tests
3. Run linting and type checking
4. Create a pull request with reference to the task document
5. After review, merge back to `master`

## Project Status Dashboard

Current progress is tracked in `docs/refactoring/STATUS.md` which is updated after each task completion.
